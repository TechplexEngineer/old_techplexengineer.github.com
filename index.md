Due to the overwhemling *belief* that the [Aurora-Sim project](http://aurora-sim.org/) is dead, I've decicedto try my hand ad writing a weekly blog about the latest developments in the Aurora-Sim Project. I'll do my best t follow the style that [Justincc](justincc.org) has been using for his [series on Opensim development](http://justincc.org/blog/category/opensim-dev/).

Below is a list of the previous blog entries.
